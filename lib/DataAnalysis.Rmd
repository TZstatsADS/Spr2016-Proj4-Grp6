# The Big picture

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Clean the data set
movies <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\NMLJ\\Documents\\GitHub\\project4-team6\\data\\datawithnameandgenre.csv", header= TRUE)
movies <- movies[,-1]
movies <- movies[,-1]
attach(movies)

#Separate Out the Review score as a factor
movies$review_score <- as.factor(review_score)

#Look at its distribution
summary(movies$review_score)
print(summary(movies$review_score))

```

We can see that 5-star reviews make up a significant amount more than 1-4 star reviews. 

##Review Distributions

However, it must be noted that movies with reviews only make up **26%** of the entire data set.  By looking at proportions of the review scores, we produce the following:

```{r, echo=FASLE}
sum.tot <- sum(review_score)
sum.tot
#The total of movies with reviews is only 129148

review.prop <- c(prop1,prop2,prop3,prop4,prop5)
names(review.label) <- c("1 Star", "2 Star","3 Star", "4 Star", "5 Star")

prop1 <- 5212/sum.tot
prop1 *100
prop2 <- 2553/sum.tot
prop2 *100
prop3 <- 3282/sum.tot
prop3*100
prop4 <- 6451/sum.tot
prop4*100
prop5 <- 16636/sum.tot
prop5*100
#The proprotion of movies with reviews is only 26%
sum(review.prop)

```

1-Star reviews make up `4%` of the movies. 2-Star reviews make up `1.976%` of the movies. 3-Star reviews are `2.54%` of the movies, 4-star reviews are `4.99%` of the movies, and 5-star reviews are `12.88%`

What does this look like graphically? With **only the reviewed movies**, this is the distribution:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
pie_review <- pie3D(review.prop, labels= names(review.label), col=colorspace::rainbow_hcl(5), main="Proportions of Subsetted Reviews")

```

But, with all of the movies in total:
```{r}
new.review.prop  <- c(review.prop, .74)
new.review.label <- c("1 star", "2 Star","3 Star", "4 Star", "5 Star", "0 Star")
names(new.review.label) <- c("1 Star", "2 Star","3 Star", "4 Star", "5 Star", "0 Star")

pie_total <- pie3D(new.review.prop, labels= names(new.review.label), col=colorspace::heat_hcl(6), main="Proportions of All Reviews")

```
