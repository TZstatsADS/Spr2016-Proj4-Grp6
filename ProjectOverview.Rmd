#Introduction and Initial Goals
![Movies!](http://eastridgecenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Movie-Releases.jpg)

In this project focused on *Collective Intelligence Mining*, the group carried out 3 main goals:

1. To discover a succinct methodology for mining Amazon movie reviews.

2. To best display the results and findings of this mining.

3. To produce something others would also find useful and inventive

Thus, the group created an interactive Shiny app, where consumers can input what they like seeing/what they are interested in seeing, and not only get information on that move, but also similar titles to such!

#Exploratory Analysis
To direct how to carry out our algorithm, as well as take into account the vast amoutn of psycology that occurs with movie watching preferences, we did both an exploratory analysis on the movie industry, as well as the data set provided.

##General Background
When looking at current research available for movie watching habits, Google and Millward Brown Digital teamed up to carry out a very indepth study of people and their movie watching habits. **What struck us the most and influenced our decisions** moving forward were the following two things:

![Movie Infographic](https://consequenceofsound.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/screen-shot-2014-11-23-at-1-48-13-pm.png?w=797)

Taking these into account, we had ready information for plot/genre, as well as review score, two core factors that certain groups of movie watchers deemed important.

Additionally, the following statistic very much influenced how we moved forward:
**70% of moviegoers don't actually choose the movie the'll see until they're at the teater**

This is very applicable in propelling us to provide a movie reccommendation app, which would help both movie-goers in theaters (becuase you can rate movies on Amazon through pre-order dvds after people saw it in theater), and people at home.

#The Reccommendation System
##The Basic Idea Behind Finding "Similar" Movies
How does someone justify what a "similar" movie is? Is it determined by genre? By actors, or directors? 
In our alogirthm development, we started with our finalized dataset, which looks like such:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\NMLJ\\Documents\\GitHub\\project4-team6\\data\\datawithnameandgenre.csv")

head(data,1)
```

To determine which factor should be used in what should be consdiered similar, after trying a few methods and seeing what type of results we got, we decided on using **Reviewer's Score**

##Why Review Score?
What we determined was that if the scores of two movies are close (taking into account number of reviews), then the movies can be determined to be similar.

To aid in accuracy, under this overarching direction, we finally decided to focus on **users who have watched both movies, and take both their scores**, and of course, all under the umbrella of the same genre as the inputted movie.

##The Functions
###The First Function 
This function gives users who rated common movies
```{r}
#Insert

```

###The Second Function 
This function gives the rating scores of the common reviews
```{r}
#Insert
```

##The Similarity
To compute the degree of overlap, we solved for the angle theta, as the angle between the two vectors, or movie review scores.

![theta](http://image.mathcaptain.com/cms/images/83/angle-between-two-vectors.png)

The function is as follows:

```{r}
#Insert

```

##Implementation

Within the app, when a user inputs a complete movie name, we calculate its similarity using our algorithm within all other movies of the same Amazon-labeled genre. Then, the app ranks the similarity values, and gives the movie which shares the greatest similarity with the user's input.

##How to Improve For The Future
In the future, we would like to be able to expand to movies of similar genres as well (rather than just the same genre), but processing and computation time took too long.

We would also love to expand into searching by *director, cast members, or sountrack*.

Looking into an app that gives multiple output suggestions would also be preferred.

#The App
To demonstrate the app, we will show you what happens if you look into **The Last Samurai**
